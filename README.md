# everyday essentials

this repository contains useful information that i refer to daily â€” from basic english grammar to terminal commands and keyboard shortcuts.

the repository is not very well maintained. at this moment, i intend to keep it casual and add useful information as I find it and will organize it better once it starts becoming a shareable resource.

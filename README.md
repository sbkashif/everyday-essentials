# everyday essentials

This repository contains useful information that I refer to daily â€” from basic English grammar to terminal commands and keyboard shortcuts.

The repository is not very well maintained. At this moment, I intend to keep it casual and add useful information as I find it. I perform commits directly from the web and not necessarily follow best practices. I will organize it better once it starts becoming a shareable resource.

## Practical Tips for Writing Clear Sentences and Paragraphs

- **Start with a clear main idea:** Each paragraph should have a single, focused topic that is introduced by a topic sentence.
- **Avoid ending sentences with prepositions:** Generally, do not end a sentence with a preposition—rephrase to improve clarity.
    - Instead of: "What are you talking about?"
    - Use: "About what are you talking?"
- **Use consistent tense:** When describing past events, use past tense verbs; for ongoing or current situations, use present tense.
- **Match subject and verb number:** Make sure singular subjects have singular verbs, and plural subjects have plural verbs.
    - Example: "The students **are** studying." / "The student **is** studying."
- **Avoid sentence fragments:** Ensure every sentence contains a subject and a predicate.
    - Fragment: "While walking to the store."
    - Corrected: "I saw her while walking to the store."
- **Use active voice where possible:** Active voice makes sentences clearer and more direct.
    - Instead of: "The report was written by the student."
    - Use: "The student wrote the report."
- **Vary sentence length:** Combine short and long sentences to improve rhythm and readability, especially in complex or detailed writing.
- **Use transition words:** To connect ideas smoothly, use words like **however**, **therefore**, **moreover**, **consequently**, etc.
- **Be concise:** Avoid unnecessary words or redundant phrases. For example, instead of "due to the fact that," simply write "because."
- **Clarify pronouns:** Ensure every pronoun clearly refers to its antecedent to avoid ambiguity.
- **Watch out for double negatives:** Avoid confusing expressions like "I don’t know nothing"—use "I don’t know anything."
- **Use correct punctuation:** Use commas to separate items in a list or clauses; use periods, question marks, and exclamation points correctly to end sentences.
- **Maintain tense consistency within paragraphs:** Don’t switch tenses unnecessarily, which can confuse the reader.
- **Use present tense for general truths:** When stating facts or general principles, use the present tense.
- **Avoid lengthy, convoluted sentences:** Break complex ideas into smaller, manageable sentences for clarity.

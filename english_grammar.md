# Sentence Construction Rules

Having had an idea on key terms and their prescribed usage, let's get into basic rules of constructing sentences and paragraphs.

## 1. Basic Sentence Components

- **Subject:** The person, place, thing, or idea that performs the action or is described. Usually a noun or pronoun.
Example: **The teacher** explains the lesson.
- **Predicate:** The part of the sentence that tells what the subject does or is. This includes the verb and any modifiers or objects.
Example: The teacher **explains the lesson clearly**.
- **Object:** A noun or pronoun that receives the action of the verb. There are two types:
    - **Direct Object:** Answers the question "What?" or "Whom?" after the verb.
Example: She reads **a book**.
    - **Indirect Object:** Answers "To whom?" or "For whom?" the action is done.
Example: She gave **me** the book.
- **Complement:** A word or phrase that completes the meaning of the subject or object, often linked by linking verbs (am, is, are, seem).
Example: She is **a teacher**.
Example: They found the movie **interesting**.
- **Modifiers:** Words or phrases (usually adjectives or adverbs) that describe or limit other words.
Example: The **tall** man (adjective modifier).
Example: She runs **quickly** (adverb modifier).


## 2. Sentence Structure Patterns

- **S (Subject) + V (Verb)**
Example: Birds sing.
- **S + V + O (Object)**
Example: She called her friend.
- **S + V + C (Complement)**
Example: The sky is blue.
- **S + V + O + C**
Example: They elected him president.
- **S + V + Adverbial (time, place, manner)**
Example: He went home early.


## 3. Sentence Types: Clause Combinations

- **Simple Sentence:** Contains one independent clause (subject + predicate).
Example: The dog barks.
- **Compound Sentence:** Two or more independent clauses joined by a coordinating conjunction (and, but, or, so).
Example: I wanted to go, but it was raining.
- **Complex Sentence:** One independent clause and at least one dependent clause introduced by subordinating conjunctions (because, although, if).
Example: She stayed home because she was sick.
- **Compound-Complex Sentence:** At least two independent clauses and one or more dependent clauses.
Example: He went to the park, but she stayed home because she was tired.


## 4. Verb and Tense Rules

- Use **verbs** to show actions (run, write) or states of being (is, seem).
- Maintain **tense consistency** across clauses unless indicating time changes.
- Use **auxiliary verbs** (have, be, will) for forming perfect and progressive tenses.


## 5. Subject-Verb Agreement

- Singular subjects take singular verbs; plural subjects take plural verbs.
Example: The cat **runs**. The cats **run**.


## 6. Voice: Active and Passive

- **Active voice:** Subject performs the action.
Example: The chef cooks dinner.
- **Passive voice:** Subject receives the action.
Example: Dinner is cooked by the chef.


## 7. Sentence Connectors and Punctuation

- Use **conjunctions** (and, but, or, because) to join clauses or ideas.
- Use commas to separate items or clauses in compound sentences.
- Use semicolons for closely related independent clauses without conjunctions.
- Use colons to introduce lists or explanations.

---

### Common Sentence Errors

- Subject-verb agreement  
- Wrong tense usage  
- Double negatives


### Sentence Variety Tips

- Mix sentence lengths for natural flow.
- Combine simple sentences with complex or compound forms for emphasis and style.
- Use **periodic sentences** (main idea at end) or **cleft sentences** (It is/was... that...) for focus.

## Paragraph Construction (Extension)

- **Topic Sentence:** Introduce the main idea of the paragraph.
- **Supporting Sentences:** Explain, provide examples, or expand on the topic sentence.
- **Transitions:** Use words like however, therefore, additionally to connect ideas smoothly.
- **Concluding Sentence:** Optional wrap-up or link to next idea.

---

## Practical Tips for Writing Clear Sentences and Paragraphs

- **Start with a clear main idea:** Each paragraph should have a single, focused topic that is introduced by a topic sentence.
- **Avoid ending sentences with prepositions:** Generally, do not end a sentence with a preposition—rephrase to improve clarity.
    - Instead of: "What are you talking about?"
    - Use: "About what are you talking?"
- **Use consistent tense:** When describing past events, use past tense verbs; for ongoing or current situations, use present tense.
- **Match subject and verb number:** Make sure singular subjects have singular verbs, and plural subjects have plural verbs.
    - Example: "The students **are** studying." / "The student **is** studying."
- **Avoid sentence fragments:** Ensure every sentence contains a subject and a predicate.
    - Fragment: "While walking to the store."
    - Corrected: "I saw her while walking to the store."
- **Use active voice where possible:** Active voice makes sentences clearer and more direct.
    - Instead of: "The report was written by the student."
    - Use: "The student wrote the report."
- **Vary sentence length:** Combine short and long sentences to improve rhythm and readability, especially in complex or detailed writing.
- **Use transition words:** To connect ideas smoothly, use words like **however**, **therefore**, **moreover**, **consequently**, etc.
- **Be concise:** Avoid unnecessary words or redundant phrases. For example, instead of "due to the fact that," simply write "because."
- **Clarify pronouns:** Ensure every pronoun clearly refers to its antecedent to avoid ambiguity.
- **Watch out for double negatives:** Avoid confusing expressions like "I don’t know nothing"—use "I don’t know anything."
- **Use correct punctuation:** Use commas to separate items in a list or clauses; use periods, question marks, and exclamation points correctly to end sentences.
- **Maintain tense consistency within paragraphs:** Don’t switch tenses unnecessarily, which can confuse the reader.
- **Use present tense for general truths:** When stating facts or general principles, use the present tense.
- **Avoid lengthy, convoluted sentences:** Break complex ideas into smaller, manageable sentences for clarity.
